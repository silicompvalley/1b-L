# Growth Mindset
A "growth mindset", unlike a fixed mindset, allows for expansion of pathways towards a goal. It also allows for different options should better ones arise and ways to correct oneself if the path trails off or a mistake is made. A fixed mindset is more rigid and difficult to navigate and improve upon.

3 reminders for me to go through this fruitfully 1: I must never give up. There is always a way 2: It feels hard? It's SUPPOSED to be hard! 3: Not smart? Surprisingly, the man who came up with the IQ test himself understood that intelligence can be increased

Hi my name is Shon. Welcome to my learning journal.

I'm from the San Francisco Bay Area and new to Seattle. Wow, Seattle is so close to me (in a travel/leisure sense) and I've never visited! I didn't know just how much of a major tourist destination Seattle is! So many places I tried to check out for housing were booked. The air and atmosphere is fresh and I really like the nice and the bustling downtown area. San Francisco may have a lot of nice destinations, but its downtown is kind of ugly and the streets are so dirty. 



# Stretch Goals
I'd like to learn to code to get into a field that is very much in demand. Also, I enjoy using computers and think it is about time I learned some of the innerworkings of software. It would be great to be able to create something useful that is totally configurable.

  The great thing about Markup is that it uses text and plain language people can understand. Thanks to its simple interface, the text of the webpage can be easily displayed and in the position one desires.
  In addition, Markup allows for graphics in the webpage. For what cool webpage full of resources will be without graphics?
